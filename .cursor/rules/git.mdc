# Git Push Shortcut

When the user says **"push"** (with or without a commit message):

1. Run `git add -A` to stage all changes
2. Run `git diff --cached --stat` to see what's being committed
3. Write a concise, meaningful commit message based on the staged changes
4. Run `git commit -m "<message>"`
5. Run `git push`

When the user says **"deploy"** (with or without a commit message):

1. Run `npm run build` to build all apps (stop on failure)
2. Run `git add -A` to stage all changes
3. Run `git diff --cached --stat` to see what's being committed
4. Write a concise, meaningful commit message based on the staged changes
5. Run `git commit -m "<message>"`
6. Run `git push`

## Commit Message Format

- Use imperative mood: "Add", "Fix", "Update", "Remove"
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- If the user provides a message after "push"/"deploy", use it as-is
- If no message is provided, summarize the changes automatically

## Build Failure

- If `npm run build` fails, **stop immediately** — do not commit or push
- Show the build error and fix it before retrying

## Examples

- User says: `push` → stage, commit, push
- User says: `push fix login bug` → commit with "Fix login bug", push
- User says: `deploy` → build, stage, commit, push
- User says: `deploy add blog feature` → build, commit with "Add blog feature", push
