# Design Source of Truth

All frontend implementation must be based on the design file `pencil.pen` at the project root.

## Workflow

1. **Before implementing any page or component**, read the design from `pencil.pen` using the Pencil MCP tools (`batch_get`, `get_screenshot`).
2. **Match the design exactly** — colors, spacing, typography, layout, and component structure.
3. **Never guess** styles or layouts. Always reference the `.pen` file for the correct values.

## How to Read the Design

- Use `batch_get` to inspect node properties (colors, fonts, padding, gaps, border radius, etc.).
- Use `get_screenshot` to visually verify what a screen or component looks like.
- Use `search_all_unique_properties` to extract color palettes and spacing tokens from specific screens.

## Design Screens in pencil.pen

| Screen | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Landing Page | Public homepage with hero, features, social proof, CTA |
| Dashboard | Authenticated user dashboard |
| Pricing Page | Plan comparison |
| Upload Contract | File upload with dropzone |
| Contracts List | User's contracts table |
| Contract Detail | Single contract view with clauses |
| Sign In / Sign Up | Authentication pages |
| Settings, Billing, Help | Account management pages |
| Onboarding – Processing | File analysis progress |
| Onboarding – Sign In Required | Post-analysis auth prompt |
| Onboarding – Add Details | Profile completion form |
| Admin Dashboard, Users, Contracts | Admin panel pages |
| Admin CRUD Modals | Add, View, Edit, Delete user modals |

## Color Themes

- **Public / User pages**: Warm orange accent (`#EA580C`), off-white background (`#FFFBF5`)
- **Admin pages**: Deep indigo accent (`#4F46E5`), dark sidebar (`#1E1B4B`)
- **Logo**: `file-search` icon, 32x32 mark, orange for public, indigo for admin

## Key Fonts

- **Headings**: Space Grotesk (600–700 weight)
- **Body**: Inter (400–500 weight)

## Rules

- Do not introduce new colors or fonts that are not in the design.
- If a component exists in the design, implement it to match — do not substitute with a different layout.
- When in doubt, take a screenshot of the relevant node and compare against your implementation.
